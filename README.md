TYPO3-extension News Snapin
===========================

Container for the TYPO3 extension news, with the advantage that the content-elements can be
assigned to define-able areas. So Wiki-pages, Knowlegbases or just feature-rich articles can be 
created. Think about diagrams, tables, individual article-layouts, footnotes and individual 
extensions bound to a single article instead of a whole page.
